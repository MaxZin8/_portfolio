This project was created for an assignment to build a 2.5 DOF electromechanical system in an introduction to design course. My role in this project was to design and manufacture all mounts, and to select actuators.

In feedback from potential customers at the Perkins Institute for the Blind, price and reliability were favored over speed. Dots needed to be uniform in height, shape, and distance apart to be legible. To achieve this, I selected a solenoid that traveled along the horizontal axis of the sheet via a lead screw, and a slot car tire to feed paper through. This feed design was intended to function similarly to that of a standard printer.
