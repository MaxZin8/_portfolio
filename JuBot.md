title: JuBot
---

JuBot is a pre-designed robotic platform built for an intro to robotics course. Throughout the course, this robot served as an experimental platform on which I wrote ROS nodes in Python, including basic image segmentation using OpenCV for line following, a simple PID controller, and a kinematic model and with IMU data for odometry.
